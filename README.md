# electricity-app

## Instructions
The widget should be able to: 

Allow a user to top-up electricity:

* R10 - 7 units
* R30 - 21 units
* R50 - 43 units
    
The widget support the appliance listed below also see the electricity consumption in units.

Supported appliances:

* TV - 3 units
* Kettle - 5 units
* Fridge - 13 units
* Stove - 10 units

Don't allow appliance usage if there is not enough electricity available to use the appliance in question.

So a summary of electricity available - the topup and using of electricity should reflect accordingly at **Unis available**. Keep track of units bought and the total amount spent on electricity.

If the advance has been used show a green tick. And advance can only be used once, until it has been paid back. Then is can be used again. Ensure the total amount spent calculation take the advance amounts into account correctly.

## Files 

* Make all the unit tests pass in `electricity.test.js`. Run test from `test/index.html`
* Fix failing unit tests by implementing the `Electricity` Factory Function in `electricity.js`. 
* Implement the DOM functionality in the `electricity.dom.js` file that is needed to make the widget in `index.html` functional.

## Add localStorage
Once the widget is done store the electricity balance in localStorage. Be sure  that the data is shown correctly after a refresh.
